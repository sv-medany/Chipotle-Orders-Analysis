# Chipotle Orders Analysis

This project involves the analysis of Chipotle orders using Python and the Pandas library. The dataset is obtained from [this source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmarkham/DAT8/master/data/chipotle.tsv), and it contains information about items ordered, their quantities, prices, and more.

## Project Overview

This repository contains Python code for analyzing Chipotle orders using the Pandas library. The analysis includes various steps to explore and understand the dataset, such as calculating statistics, finding most-ordered items, and determining revenue. The primary goals of this project are:

- Analyze Chipotle orders dataset using Pandas.
- Calculate statistics like the number of observations, number of columns, and more.
- Identify the most-ordered item and its quantity.
- Determine total revenue generated from orders.
- Explore average revenue amount per order.

## Steps in the Analysis

1. Import necessary libraries, including Pandas and NumPy.
2. Import the Chipotle dataset from the provided source.
3. Assign the dataset to a variable called `chipo`.
4. Display the first 10 entries in the dataset.
5. Determine the number of observations and columns in the dataset.
6. Print the names of all the columns.
7. Explore dataset indexing.
8. Identify the most-ordered item and its quantity.
9. Find the most ordered item in the `choice_description` column.
10. Calculate the total number of items ordered.
11. Convert the item price to a float data type.
12. Calculate the total revenue generated from orders.
13. Determine the number of distinct orders made.
14. Calculate the average revenue amount per order.
15. Count the different items sold.
